ZeluxDL splits every download into up to **32 parallel connections**, keeps them all busy until
the last byte, and survives crashes, sleep and pulled cables. Click a link in your browser and
ZeluxDL takes over; hover a video and grab it as **MP4 in the quality you want — or just the MP3**.
All of it in a calm, liquid-glass interface with dark, light, and exclusive Zelux Pulse themes.

Free, open source, no ads, no accounts, no telemetry.

## ✨ Why ZeluxDL

| | |
|---|---|
| ⚡ **Up to 15× faster** | On servers that throttle each connection, ZeluxDL's multi-connection engine is up to 15× faster than a normal browser download ([benchmarks](#-benchmarks)). |
| 🔗 **Multi-Host Resolvers** | Built-in direct link resolvers for Google Drive, Google Docs/Sheets/Slides, Dropbox (`dl=1`), Pixeldrain, OneDrive/SharePoint, VikingFile, Hugging Face, and GitHub. |
| 🖼 **Media Grid Picker** | Batch download window with live thumbnail grid view, quick card multi-selection, and filter by extension. |
| 🔁 **Never start over** | Pause, close the laptop, lose power — ZeluxDL resumes exactly where it stopped and checks that the file on the server hasn't changed. |
| 🌐 **Lives in your browser** | Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera, Vivaldi and Firefox. Downloads jump into ZeluxDL in about a quarter of a second. |
| 🎬 **Video & music** | YouTube and [1,800+ sites](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/supportedsites.md): MP4 up to 8K/HDR or MP3 only, with subtitles, chapters and SponsorBlock. |
| 🧲 **Every protocol** | HTTP(S), FTP/FTPS, HLS and DASH streams, BitTorrent and magnet links. |
| 🤖 **AI models** | Download models from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co) by name, link or search. ZeluxDL picks the files you need (one GGUF version, the weights in one format), downloads them over many connections and checks each against its SHA-256. |
| 🗂 **Organised** | Categories, queues with schedules and speed limits, "shut down when done", site grabber, batch downloads, clipboard monitor. |
| 🌍 **Your language** | Thai (ภาษาไทย), English, Czech, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Indonesian, Turkish, and Arabic. |
| 🎨 **Gorgeous** | Liquid-glass design, dark & light themes, exclusive **Zelux Pulse** neon violet theme, and compact mini window. |

## 🌐 Browser extension (1 minute)

**[Add Prism from the Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/prism-download-manager/mmcdeiglkbfbicdjboocmhehodogilfl)**
— Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera, Vivaldi and Helium. Click **Add to Chrome**, pin the Prism icon, and it
says **Connected**. The store keeps it up to date.

Prism also walks you through this on first start (and any time from **Settings → Browser
integration**). Firefox, Edge/Opera notes, troubleshooting and privacy details:
**[Browser extension guide](docs/guide/browser-extension.md)**.

## 📊 Benchmarks

Same files, same machine, every result verified by SHA-256
([method & full results](docs/benchmarks.md)):

| Scenario | curl (1 connection) | aria2c | **Prism** |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 GiB from a server that throttles each connection | 4.0 MiB/s | 61.0 MiB/s | **60.9 MiB/s** |
| 2 GiB, no network limit | 672 MiB/s | 324 MiB/s | **1029 MiB/s** |
| Server allows only 4 connections | 2.0 MiB/s | 8.0 MiB/s | **8.0 MiB/s** (max) |
| Server that randomly drops connections | — | ✘ gave up | **37.7 MiB/s** ✔ |
| Real internet, ≈ 200 Mbit/s line | 25.9 MiB/s | 25.2 MiB/s | **25.1 MiB/s** (line speed) |

## 🧠 How it works

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/media/banner.jpg" width="860" alt="One beam, many rays">
</p>

* **Dynamic segmentation.** When a connection finishes its part, it takes over half of the
  largest part still remaining — so every connection stays busy until the very end and the
  slow tail gets split down instead of waiting on one slow socket.
* **Server-aware.** Prism notices when a server refuses extra connections, settles on what it
  allows and remembers it per host.
* **Straight to disk.** Data is written directly into the final file (sparse on NTFS,
  pre-allocated on Linux) — no slow "assembling" step at the end.
* **Crash-safe.** Progress is checkpointed only after data is flushed to disk; on resume Prism
  validates size, ETag and Last-Modified with `If-Range`.
* **Rust + Tauri.** A Rust engine (tokio, rustls), a React UI in a native Tauri 2 shell — small,
  fast and memory-friendly.

## ❓ FAQ

<details><summary><b>Is it really free?</b></summary>

Yes. MIT-licensed, no ads, no trial, no account, no telemetry. The extension talks only to
the app on your own computer.
</details>

<details><summary><b>Windows / macOS says the app is unsafe.</b></summary>

The installers aren't signed with a paid certificate. The code is all here and every release
is built by GitHub Actions from this repository, with `SHA256SUMS.txt` to verify your file.
</details>

<details><summary><b>Can I use it together with IDM or another download manager?</b></summary>

Yes, but disable their browser extension — two extensions fighting over the same download
means neither works reliably.
</details>

<details><summary><b>Which sites can it download video from?</b></summary>

Every site supported by [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp), which Prism installs and
keeps up to date for you (together with ffmpeg). Please download only content you have the
right to download.
</details>

<details><summary><b>How do I download a model from Hugging Face?</b></summary>

Click the model button in the toolbar (or paste a model's name like `Qwen/Qwen3-8B`, or its link,
into *Add URL*). Pick a version if the model has several, and click *Download*: the files go into
the *Hugging Face* queue. For gated or private models, add an access token in Settings › AI models
(Prism also uses the one `hf auth login` saved). The token is sent only to Hugging Face, never to
the servers the files come from.
</details>

<details><summary><b>Does it work on Linux Flatpak/Snap browsers?</b></summary>

Flatpak browsers can't talk to desktop apps (a sandbox limitation). Use the deb/rpm version of
your browser for full integration.
</details>
